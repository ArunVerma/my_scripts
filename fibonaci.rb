# Below class is for showing how to take inputs from user
# This will take 3 inputs from user and will create the fibonaci series
# input 1 : first number of the series
# input 2 : second number of the series
# input 3 : length of the series
# Program will start on creating new object of FibonaciSeries class.
# FibonaciSeries.new
